# Moment Model Mapping

Contains all the code necessary to reproduce the analysis and plots in the paper 'Moment delta mapping (MDM) as a replacement for quantile delta mapping (QDM): Bias-correcting future temperature without quantile crossings' by Harsha R. Hampapura and David M. Romps. The final version of the code will be available after the publication of the paper.
